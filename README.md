# shellsort-13-4-1

Here is some code that finds the worst possible input for (13-4-1) shellsort on 25 elements. This was an undergrad homework problem somewhere in space and time... 
which turns out to be doable afterall, in reasonable O(1 day) runtime, with enough tricks and stuff.. and 8 cores. See FIXME
